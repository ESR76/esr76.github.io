title: "I've Graduated from UC San Diego!"
---

As I've given away in the title, I am so honored to announce that about two weeks ago on June 18, 2023, I graduated from UC San Diego with a Bachelor's in Data Science from UC San Diego (more specifically, [the Halicioglu Data Science Institute / HDSI](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and a bonus minor in Biological Sciences.

Going to college was certainly one of the biggest achievements and adventures of my lifetime, and it never ran smooth.

I toured UC San Diego in my junior year in high school, and even after I visited other schools and continued to consider my future, the feeling I had stepping on UC San Diego's campus stuck with me. So when I got accepted, it felt like the obvious choice, even with my major as yet undeclared and the path ahead of me unclear.

And then of course, after my first quarter and a half at university - COVID hit. My family had just visited me in mid-February assuming everything would be as it usually was. Then as we reached the final few weeks of winter quarter, more and more changed. One day, only 5 people showed up in person to my final "Intro to Data Science" lecture. The next, classes were announced as being moved online for all of spring quarter. And finally, one day we were all told that unless we had a specific reason to stay in San Diego to take our online classes (ie. no internet at home, etc.), we should move out immediately. And so, less than a month after my family visit, my family came by again, this time to move me back home from a life I had only just begun to fully get accustomed to.

I didn't come back to UC San Diego in person for a year and a half, returning in August 2021.

COVID changed so much of my college experience, and for the sake of brevity, I won't list every way here. But here are a few ways:
