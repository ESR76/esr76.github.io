Hello, everyone!

My name is Esperanza and I am a recent data science graduate from UC San Diego - thanks for making your way over to my website!

Here you can find more in depth descriptions of some of my projects and writing that I've done, both during my time in school and beyond, by following the tabs for [Projects](https://esr76.github.io/projects/){:target="_blank"} and [Blog](https://esr76.github.io/blog/){:target="_blank"}. 

If you'd like to find me on other platforms, reach out using the icons below.
