Hello, everyone!

My name is Esperanza and I am data analyst & scientist with experience in language processing (NLP), 

Here you can find more in depth descriptions of some of my projects and writing that I've done, both during my time in school and beyond, by following the tabs for [Projects](https://esr76.github.io/projects/){:target="_blank"} and [Blog](https://esr76.github.io/blog/){:target="_blank"}. 

Aside from my work, I'm also interested in soccer: men's (Real Madrid) and women's (San Diego Wave FC), video games, movies, and involvement in my local community through volunteering and education.

If you'd like to contact me or find me on other platforms, please use the icons below. Thanks!
